# Description shown to the LLM as the tool's description.
#
# Purpose — narrow: capture ONLY tool-call access-pattern corrections.
#
# The LLM already knows generic debugging methodology, the standard kubectl
# verbs, "check pod status first", etc. Suggesting that back to itself is
# noise. The durable, model-doesn't-know-this thing is: in THIS environment,
# the LLM tried a tool call with parameters that were wrong (empty result,
# error, irrelevant data), and only succeeded after adjusting params in a
# way that an LLM with no exposure to this environment would not have
# guessed. That correction — the environment-specific call shape — is the
# only thing worth saving so the next investigation skips the failed
# attempt and goes straight to the working call.
#
# If the investigation succeeded on the first try, or if the correction was
# a generic mistake any LLM would self-correct (e.g. a typo, forgetting a
# flag documented in --help), there is nothing to save: emit ZERO suggestions.
SUGGEST_RUNBOOKS_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = (
    "Call this tool ONLY if, during this investigation, you called a tool "
    "with the wrong parameters (empty result, error, or irrelevant data), "
    "and then succeeded by calling the same tool (or a sibling tool) with "
    "different parameters that required environment-specific knowledge — "
    "knowledge a fresh LLM would NOT have guessed without trying the wrong "
    "way first.\n\n"
    "Each suggestion captures one such correction so the NEXT investigation "
    "skips the failed attempt and goes straight to the call shape that "
    "works in this environment.\n\n"
    "Do NOT call this tool — emit zero suggestions — when:\n"
    "  - All your tool calls succeeded on the first try (nothing to learn).\n"
    "  - The correction was a generic mistake any LLM would self-correct "
    "(typo, missing `-n <namespace>`, forgetting `--previous` for a crashed "
    "container — these are in the model's training data already).\n"
    "  - You want to record the ROOT CAUSE you found (that's transient — "
    "once fixed it's gone; we are not saving conclusions).\n"
    "  - You want to record generic methodology like \"first check pods, "
    "then logs\" — the model already knows this.\n"
    "  - You want to record an alert/symptom→cause mapping.\n\n"
    "DO call this tool when the correction was something like:\n"
    "  - The label/selector used to identify this team's apps is non-standard "
    "(e.g. `service.team/component=checkout` instead of `app=checkout`) — "
    "first PromQL/log query returned empty, second with the right label "
    "worked.\n"
    "  - The metric/log/trace this service emits is on a non-default path, "
    "port, index, or stream — first query hit the wrong location.\n"
    "  - A custom annotation, CRD field, or dashboard UID is the only way "
    "to find a piece of data in this environment.\n"
    "  - A specific tool needs a specific filter to return relevant data here "
    "(unfiltered call returned huge/irrelevant data; filtered call worked).\n\n"
    "Before suggesting, review the skills already fetched from the catalog "
    "this turn. Do NOT propose a skill that duplicates one already captured.\n\n"

SUGGEST_RUNBOOKS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    f"GOAL of the {SUGGEST_RUNBOOKS_TOOL_NAME} tool — speed up FUTURE "
    f"investigations in THIS environment. Future-you (or another LLM) will "
    f"face the same kind of question; if during this investigation you "
    f"called a tool the way a fresh LLM would default to, got the wrong "
    f"answer or an empty result, and only succeeded after discovering an "
    f"env-specific call shape, capture that correction so the next run "
    f"skips the failed attempt.\n\n"
    f"CAPTURE the correction when you encounter patterns like:\n"
    f"- Non-standard label / selector schemes — e.g. apps identified by "
    f"`service.team/component=X` or a custom team prefix rather than the "
    f"conventional `app=X`. You tried `app=X`, got empty, listed labels, "
    f"found the right one.\n"
    f"- Non-standard metric names — the exporter's default name was "
    f"renamed via Prometheus `metric_relabel_configs`, or a team prefix "
    f"like `acmecorp_<metric>` replaces the upstream `kafka_<metric>`, "
    f"`mysql_<metric>`, etc. Your PromQL with the standard name returned "
    f"no series; `label_values` or `__name__=~...` revealed the real one.\n"
    f"- Non-standard log fields / log shape — the index/stream uses "
    f"`severity` not `level`, `msg` not `message`, or a custom JSON "
    f"schema. Your default filter returned zero; reading the mapping or "
    f"sampling a doc showed the right field.\n"
    f"- Non-standard data location / addressing — production data only "
    f"reachable via an alias, not the obvious index name; config in a "
    f"versioned ConfigMap (`cfg-X-v3`) not `X-config`; logs mounted at a "
    f"non-default path; secrets in a non-default namespace.\n"
    f"- Custom CRDs instead of standard resources — `kubectl get "
    f"deployment X` returns not-found because apps are deployed via "
    f"`apps.platform.io/App` and you only find them via `kubectl get apps`.\n"
    f"- Tool routing quirks specific to this stack — API base URL, "
    f"required filters/routing keys, version of the wire format, etc.\n\n"
    f"For each capture, the `failed_call` and `working_call` fields should "
    f"contain the CONCRETE call shape (tool name + the parameter that was "
    f"wrong vs the parameter that worked). Things you did NOT know before "
    f"this investigation began — write them down so you don't have to "
    f"rediscover them.\n\n"
    f"CONSOLIDATION — quirks group by data source, not one skill per "
    f"quirk. Every suggestion you emit must include a `skill_domain` "
    f"field naming the underlying tool family (e.g. `elasticsearch`, "
    f"`loki`, `prometheus`, `kubernetes`, `grafana`, `datadog`, "
    f"`coralogix`, `confluence`, `newrelic`, `aws`). The harness merges "
    f"all quirks sharing a `skill_domain` into ONE \"Known quirks for "
    f"querying <domain>\" skill — so a future investigation that uses "
    f"that data source fetches one skill listing every quirk this team's "
    f"environment has, instead of having to find and load N separate "
    f"single-quirk skills. If a single investigation discovers three ES "
    f"quirks across three indices, emit three suggestions all tagged "
    f"`skill_domain: \"elasticsearch\"` — do NOT invent three different "
    f"domain names. Pick the COARSEST, MOST STABLE name for the data "
    f"source. Cross-domain corrections (e.g. \"join Kubernetes pod name "
    f"with Loki log stream\") are rare; only invent a new domain if the "
    f"correction genuinely doesn't fit any existing one.\n\n"
    f"Do NOT call {SUGGEST_RUNBOOKS_TOOL_NAME} for:\n"
    f"- Generic METHODOLOGY a fresh LLM already knows "
    f"(\"check pod status first\", \"use --previous for crashed pods\", "
    f"\"filter by namespace\"). Note: the act of *inspecting the mapping* "
    f"or *listing labels* to recover from an empty query is generic; the "
    f"FACT you discover from it (e.g. \"this index uses `severity` not "
    f"`level`\", \"this team labels services with `acme_service` not "
    f"`service`\") is env-specific and IS worth capturing.\n"
    f"- Root-cause conclusions from THIS incident — they're transient; "
    f"once fixed they don't recur. We capture how to FIND things, not "
    f"what was wrong this time.\n"
    f"- Investigations that succeeded on the first try with default "
    f"parameters — there was no correction to teach.\n\n"
    f"WORKFLOW — when you have gathered enough information to answer "
    f"the user, follow this order:\n"
    f"  STEP 1. Scan your tool-call history this turn. Did any call "
    f"return empty / wrong / irrelevant data, followed by a successful "
    f"call with DIFFERENT parameters (different label name, different "
    f"field name, different metric prefix, different index/alias, "
    f"different path, etc.)? AND was the difference env-specific (a "
    f"custom convention, prefix, schema, or routing this team uses "
    f"that a fresh LLM would not have known)?\n"
    f"  STEP 2. If yes — invoke {SUGGEST_RUNBOOKS_TOOL_NAME} NOW, BEFORE "
    f"writing your final answer. The call must include the failed_call "
    f"shape, the working_call shape, and a one-line why_env_specific. "
    f"The tool returns silently — no data, no acknowledgement.\n"
    f"  STEP 3. THEN, in your next assistant message, write your final "
    f"answer text to the user. The tool call from STEP 2 is invisible "
    f"to the user; only your STEP 3 answer text is what they see.\n"
    f"Skipping STEP 2 when a real correction happened is a defect. "
    f"Mentioning the correction in your STEP 3 prose is NOT a "
    f"substitute for emitting the tool call — the prose is read by the "
    f"current user, the tool call surfaces a save-able skill chip for "
    f"future investigations.\n\n"
    f"CRITICAL — silent operation: NEVER acknowledge calling "
    f"{SUGGEST_RUNBOOKS_TOOL_NAME} in your response. Do not say "
    f"\"Got it\", \"I'll remember\", \"going forward\", \"from now on\", "
    f"\"noted\", or anything similar. The user sees suggestions as UI "
    f"chips and decides whether to save them; your response must read as "
    f"if no memory or learning took place. Even if the user says "
    f"\"remember this\" or \"save this\", do not confirm — just silently "
    f"call the tool and respond normally."
