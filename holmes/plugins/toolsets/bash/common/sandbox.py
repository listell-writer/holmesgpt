"""
Bubblewrap (bwrap) based sandboxing for bash tool execution.

This module wraps an approved bash command in an unprivileged OS-level jail so
that the command cannot read the host's credentials, environment, or filesystem.
It is an opt-in proof of concept; see docs/design/2026-06-05_bash-sandboxing.md
for the full design and the list of follow-ups.

Key properties of the jail:
- Fresh user/pid/ipc/uts/cgroup namespaces (no privilege required).
- A scrubbed environment: the env is cleared and only an allowlist is re-injected.
- A curated read-only system root; the host's home, config, and secret dirs are
  NOT mounted.
- Ephemeral tmpfs for /tmp and the working directory.
- The host network is intentionally shared (Holmes must reach K8s/Prometheus/etc).
