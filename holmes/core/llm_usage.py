# Minimum prompt size (in tokens) before prompt caching is expected to kick in.

class PromptCachingValidator:
    """Detects when prompt caching looks misconfigured during an agentic loop.

    Holmes runs an agentic loop that makes many sequential LLM calls sharing a
    large, growing prefix (system prompt + tool schemas + prior turns). With
    prompt caching working, the first call *creates* the cache and every call
    after it should report cache *read* tokens. When a caching-enabled model
    repeatedly reports zero cache reads on a large prompt, caching is almost
    certainly not working - a common symptom of a model/deployment that hasn't
    been set up for prompt caching. That silently inflates cost and latency.

    This logs a single warning per investigation when that pattern is seen,
    while avoiding false positives:

    - models where Holmes doesn't enable caching (e.g. Gemini) are skipped
    - the first call is skipped (it creates the cache; reads start on call 2)
    - prompts below the provider minimum (~1024 tokens) are skipped
    - once a non-zero cache read is observed, caching is confirmed working and
      no further checks are made
